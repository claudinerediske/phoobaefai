The wifi driver is a Qualcomm Atheros AR5BWB222 wireless network adapter. I'm on windows 8.1 64 bit. amp#x200B; Here's the story: amp#x200B; My current shaw promotion is ending and to save money my duplex neighbour and I agreed to share wifi if I contribute to their bill. (Please no life advice, my neighbour and I are friends and I've already heard of all the risks, please don't bother). amp#x200B;

So randomly, out of nowhere, my laptop stopped finding any available wifi- i live in an apartment complex theres at least 10 within range that i see on my phone including the one I use which my phone is signed onto. So i know its not the wifi. I checked the driver status and read this error message: Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged I've tried to connect 2 bt speakers and other devices, including the TV. The system doesn't see anything when I press "search for devices" in "Printers and Devices". Bluetooth is on in services and the devices are turned on and waiting to be recognized too. On top of that I have PC set to discovareble etc. I've tried to re-install the drivers too, but no luck.

I have an issue with my laptop killing the Wi-Fi connection. Basically, when I connect my Acer Nitro 5 to the router, it works for about 10-15 mins and then the Wi-Fi drops all the connections. None of the other laptops and smartphones are connecting to the network unless I turn off the Wi-Fi on my laptop and restart the router. Laptop works fine on any other Wi-Fi connection. Only this particular router seems to have the issue. Its TP-LINK WR840N v2. Also all the other devices I think I've tried everything to try to bring the bluetooth back, but it's no use. I think it disappeared from my laptop around 2,5 years ago, but now it started to really bother me. The BT driver doesn't appear at all in the device manager. Not in unknown devices, nor in under any other category.

It still isn't back after a hard reset, so I'm assuming the wifi card needs to be replaced, but a few days ago the ethernet went the same way. I haven't uninstalled that driver, but ethernet won't work with any cord on any port. The wireless card issue seems to be somewhat common with this Qualcomm Atheros card but I don't see anyone I've tried to connect 2 bt speakers and other devices, including the TV.

Specs: i5 3230m, Intel HD Graphics 4000, 12 gb RAM -- Acer Aspire E1 571 Laptop I was going to install Ubuntu Linux, but you can't run fortnite battle royale on Linux, or Roblox either. So the only option i thought was Mac OSX, it looks beautiful and also its a Unix OS so it's a great alternative for me than Linux. And has many games that i like too, but aren't available on Linux. (no linux port / run with wine but its slow.) I would like to dualboot it with my laptop. Quest.

I recently tried to connect my Acer Predator G3-605 model to a wireless modem, but i can't and heres the problem: -My computer doesn't have a single option related to Wi-Fi. Literally the word "Wifi" or even wireless doesnt even exist anywhere on the computer. -In device manager, the computer doesn't even show any wireless cards, nor any drivers for it -I tried installing Atheros qualcomm driver and at the end of installation it says i have no wireless card inserted -Which is extremly weird.

Hi, I have a new notebook \(Acer Aspire V15 Nitro VN7\-593G\-74FW\) with Windows 10 and the network card "Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A". After a brief amount of time online the notebook causes the whole Wifi router to crash and restart. The router is manufactured by ZTE \(3HuiTube\), I can't find a model\-number for the router or anything similar to that, it seems to be a ISP specific device, with very few information online and setting possibilities on the configuration page. All other devices. Hello guys, Long time lurker, first time poster. Please help me make a good decision regarding which laptop I should go with. I'm aiming for the best compatibility and performance on Linux — I'm primarily not looking to dual-boot, max. run a Windows VM if it's absolutely necessary otherwise WINE all the way for non-supported Windows applications). What I will be doing: Work and fun: Viewing PDFs, images, photos, word documents, slideshows, and watching movies, YouTube, browsing Hello - first ever request for help here but my Google skills have apparently deserted me. We have a new Planet WNAP-C3220 Wireless Access Point set up in a small office configured to use a Radius Server for authentication. Everyone in the office can connect various smartphones (Apple and Android) using their domain accounts and everything works fine. My MacBook Pro also connects fine. The rest of the machines are all thin clients connected to the main switch using ethernet. A couple. Dual booted Windows 8.1 and Fedora 25. The ONLY thing I miss is how fast Windows + Chrome browses compared to Fedora + Firefox. As as additional note, I am judging on "feel of speed" rather than any measurement, because I don't know how to measure what any one thing may or may not have done to improve / decrease browsing speed. Any thoughts on how to actually measure this would be appreciated. Specs: Acer Aspire laptop, 8GB RAM, Pentium quad core, Qualcomm Atheros QCA9565 / AR9565 Wireless. Hi ! I've been using an Acer laptop to play some games on for quite some time now. For the last year or so, i've been having so many issue with my network connection. Most of times it works really good, but sometimes my Wifi shuts off. This happens mostly after I restart my laptop. I can't 'enable' my wifi. When I able it, it automatically disables it again by itself. I used to be able to fix this by using some commands or leaving the laptop on for a couple of hours and restarting. 
This week I already had some BSOD's. Managed to fix it by reinstalling windows. But yesterday windows did a update and when it had restarted my wifi adapter was gone. So I went to device manager and saw that was disabled in some way. It gave a code 45. Tried to update the driver but no success. Then i noticed that there were new adapters added. The WAN miniport stuff and I tried to disable it but also no success. And today I tried to reinstall again in the hope that the adapter would Hi !

Hi I've been debugging this problem for some time now and can't find any solution. Wifi on my laptop (Acer V3-372 with Windows 10 Creators Update) works in a weird way - it always connects to any network I want it to, but when transferring data it's speed is limited and it gets regular speed bumps. It looks kinda like a sine wave. ( This is while downloading a large file through SMB, no other traffic. Normal speed should be above 32Mbps in this case. Can't really notic. I just moved into a new duplex and the landlord offers their own wifi for use. The strength i get is pretty weak in one half of the studio, and the other half gets nearly no connection whatsoever. I've got some ~4 year old Acer PC with a Qualcomm Atheros ar5bwb222 built-in wifi adapter (i don't know if that's a poor model or if it's good). Can i purchase a better external USB wifi adapter that might increase my range amp connectivity? Or is the underlying issue the distance (and walls) betwe. I am quite impressed with my new 0 Acer laptop and I would like to share my thoughts on it. ampnbsp; For 0 you get: i5-6200U (Skylake 2-core w.

TLDR: Laptop wifi adaptor on Windows 7/10 often (50%) won't connect to home network ("DaWifi") after computer boot; with some head-scratching exceptions. Windows says: "Windows was unable to connect to DaWifi", immediately when attempting to connect, as if there's no negotiation with the router. Troubleshooting wizard reveals: "This network is marked as a "hidden" network and is either not in range of this computer or the wirele. It is my first week on Linux. I am running kubuntu 16.04 on a new Acer F15 laptop. I have no trouble connecting or staying connected to wifi; I'm writing this post from my laptop right now. However, the signal strength is much worse on this laptop than on nearby devices, an Acer Aspire 5750 running Windows 7 and an iPhone 5. Signal strength is always 50-70% unless 20 cm or less from the signal source. All of this happens when the laptop is plugged in. I want to know whether there is anything. Помогите!
